# DEPRECATED
This project was abandoned eventually and I don't really feel enthusiastic about continuing it. More likely I'm gonna start something new, like, with observables and graphql and unicorns and all that stuff. Still, I learned a lot.

# Korolev.dk
[Korolev.dk](https://korolev.dk) is my personal website and (more likely) my personal playground. It is under construction for now and uses:
- [Vortigern](https://github.com/barbar/vortigern) as a boilerplate.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) because who else but TS.
- [Feathers](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers) and Express for CRUD services and as an application server.
- [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) for storing data on the server-side.
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for views.
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) for managing application state.
